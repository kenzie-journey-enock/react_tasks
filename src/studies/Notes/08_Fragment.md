# Fragment

## Introduction  
In JSX, unlike HTML, only a single root tag is allowed in a return or file. This restriction might lead us to believe that every component must have a single main element. However, this is not true thanks to a feature called "Fragment," which we explored in this lesson.  

## Fragment  
A Fragment in JSX is essentially an "invisible" tag that does not render anything in the DOM. It is useful when we need a component or return to include multiple root tags.  

For example:  
```jsx
export const Example = () => {
   return (
      <>
         <header>Header</header>
         <div>
            <p>Content</p>
         </div>
         <footer>Footer</footer>
      </>
   );
};
```  
Here, three main tags (header, div, and footer) are wrapped within a Fragment.  

## Syntactic Alternative  
In most applications, Fragments are represented as shown above. However, a more explicit syntax can also be used:  

```jsx
import { Fragment } from "react";

export const Example = () => {
   return (
      <Fragment>
         <header>Header</header>
         <div>
            <p>Content</p>
         </div>
         <footer>Footer</footer>
      </Fragment>
   );
};
```  
In this example, the `Fragment` component is explicitly imported from React. While the syntax is more verbose, the functionality remains identical to the shorthand version.  

## Conclusion  
In this lesson, I learned about Fragments and how they allow us to overcome JSX's syntactic limitation of having a single root element per component. Fragments make it possible to include multiple main tags without affecting the DOM. This understanding will help in writing cleaner and more flexible JSX code! ðŸš€
