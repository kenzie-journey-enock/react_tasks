# React useState

## Introduction
I started learning about managing and manipulating state in React. This lesson focused on understanding the foundational state handler: `useState`. I discovered that `useState` works by combining three key elements:

1. **State Variable**: Stores the current value.
2. **State Modifier Function**: Updates the value.
3. **Initial Value Parameter**: Defines the starting value of the state.

The syntax looked like this:
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

## Naming Conventions in the Community
Naming elements in programming can be challenging, but I learned about common naming patterns in the React community, which predominantly uses English. For example:
- A state variable holding a single fruit would be named `fruit`, while a list of fruits would be `fruits`.
- Modifier functions follow the format `set<StateName>`, like `setFruit` or `setFruits`.
- For arrays, a common convention is to add "List," such as `fruitList`.

## Immutability of State in React
State in React is immutable, meaning it cannot be directly modified. This immutability ensures predictable behavior and prevents unwanted side effects. I understood the distinction between **mutable methods** (not recommended) and **immutable methods** (preferred):

- **Mutable methods**: `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `sort`, `splice`.
- **Immutable methods**: `map`, `filter`, `find`, `some`, `reduce`, `slice`.

Directly assigning new values to state variables is also not allowed. Instead, updates must be done through the state modifier function, `set`.

## Spread Operator
To handle state updates while maintaining immutability, the spread operator (`...`) became my new best friend. This operator allows me to create new arrays or objects while preserving the existing data. Examples included:
- Adding to arrays:
  ```jsx
  setNameList([...nameList, "Alysson"]);
  ```
- Modifying objects:
  ```jsx
  const teacher = { name: 'Alex', budget: 8000, job: "Instructor" };
  const newTeacher = { ...teacher, budget: 9000 };
  ```

This newfound skill with the spread operator will be invaluable as I continue exploring React development. ðŸ˜„
