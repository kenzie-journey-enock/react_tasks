# Good Practices

## Introduction
In this lesson, I learned about some best practices and conventions when working with JavaScript and React. These practices help write cleaner, more readable, and maintainable code.

## Use `const` or `let` instead of `var`
I learned that using `var` is not recommended due to potential bugs. Instead, I should use `const` for variables that don't change and `let` for those that do. This helps make the code more predictable and secure.

## Declare Variables and Functions with Descriptive Names
Naming variables and functions clearly is essential. This makes the code easier to understand because the name itself indicates what the variable or function does.

## Properly Indent Code
I realized that proper indentation is crucial for readability. It makes it easier to identify code blocks, control structures, and the hierarchy of elements, even in complex projects.

## Standardize Your Code
I learned that standardizing code is important for consistency in style, structure, and naming conventions. This improves readability, maintenance, and collaboration among developers. Some aspects of standardization include:
- Whether or not to include a semicolon at the end of each statement.
- Choosing between double or single quotes.
- Deciding whether to use arrow functions or regular functions for defining components and functions.
- Using only one language for naming variables and functions.

## Componentize Your Code
Breaking the code into smaller, reusable, and independent parts is important for development, maintenance, and scalability. This practice encourages modularity, which makes the code more manageable and flexible.

## Avoid Code Duplication
I learned to identify and refactor repeated code into reusable functions or components. This reduces duplication and makes the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

## Organize Your Code
Using a well-organized file and folder structure is crucial. Itâ€™s important to separate responsibilities and follow naming conventions to make the code easier to navigate and maintain.

## Remove Comments in Final Deliverables
According to Clean Code principles, I should avoid excessive comments in the code, as they can indicate a lack of clarity or organization. A well-structured and self-explanatory code is preferred.

## Remove `console.log` in Final Code
I should remove any `console.log` statements from the final version of the code, as they are used for debugging and can clutter the production logs.

## Test Your Code
Before delivering my code, I should test it in production to ensure everything works as expected.

## Conclusion
These best practices are just the beginning. As I gain more experience with JavaScript and React, I will explore more advanced practices. The key is to keep the code organized, readable, and maintainable while continuing to learn and grow.
