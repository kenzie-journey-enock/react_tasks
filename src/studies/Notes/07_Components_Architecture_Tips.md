# Components: Architecture Tips

## **Architecture**  
I learned how to create and relate components in React, and now Iâ€™ve explored how to organize them effectively within a project. While thereâ€™s no strict folder structure required by React, having a well-organized file and folder structure can significantly improve project maintainability.

## **Pages**  
I discovered the concept of creating larger components that represent application pages. These are often named with a suffix or prefix like "Page" and grouped in a `pages` folder inside the `src` directory.

## **Structures**  
I learned that pages can be divided into smaller structural components. For example, a page can have a header, an inner section, and a form, each represented as a separate component. These structural components are scalable and reusable across the application.  
They are typically stored in the `components` folder, with related components grouped hierarchically. For instance:  
- `ProductList`: `components/ProductList`  
- `ProductCard` (used by `ProductList`): `components/ProductList/ProductCard`

## **Fragments**  
Fragments are smaller building blocks of a layout. For instance, a label and input pair might be repeated across different forms in the application. Fragments are highly reusable and can be stored in the `components` folder or a dedicated `fragments` folder for better organization.  

## **Key Takeaway**  
Itâ€™s unnecessary to create components that mimic existing HTML tags, as this would be redundant and inefficient. Instead, focus on building scalable, reusable, and meaningful components for a more maintainable application structure. ðŸ˜Š
